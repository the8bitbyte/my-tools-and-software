         <h1>Wrath v2</h1>
         <P>Discription<br><br>Wrath v2 is a ethical computer virus i made for fun without malicious intent, it is based off the wrath framework i made for one of my failed projects, wrath v1. Wrath uses a powershell script to infect files and do other things that the executable doesnt have permission to do.<br><br>Technologies Used<br><br>Wrath v2 is written in C# and uses powershell for a lot of the<br> backend<br><br>Challenges<br><br>during the development of Wrath v2 i faced a lot of issues, the most<br> notable of which is a error with the assembaly signing this one was<br> challenging to solve for there was little documentation on it, i fixed<br> it by downgrading one of the packages used</P>
         <div class="alert">
          
          Warning<br> Dispite Wrath being ethical, it is still a computer virus, do not run on your main computer, use a spare one or a VM

         <h1>Zeus crypt</h1>
         <p>Discription<br><br>Zeus crypt is file encryption tool, it works for any file type, at first<br> this was more of a challenge for myself but as i got farther in i made<br> it more user friendly and improved the general usablilty so i decided<br> to publish it.<br><br>Technologies Used<br><br></p>Zeus crypt is a very bare bones application, it doesnt use any librarys or packages<br><br>Challenges<br><br>due to encryption dealing with the raw file data, it is easy to imagine issues are commen, the challenges i faced during the development of Zeus crypt are too many to list.
         <div class="alert">
